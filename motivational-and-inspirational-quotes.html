									<p>Hey guys! Enjoy these motivational & inspirational quotes. And while you are reading these quotes, I want you to really think about how these quotes if at all, have an impact in your life. Did these quotes help you realize something from a different angle? Did they helped you get a better understanding of something you didn't understand before? Did they get you to go through with an idea that you planned on throwing away? Don't just read these quotes without giving it a good run on the old treadmill, lol. Happy thinking!</p>
