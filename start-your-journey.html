									<p>You new to AchieveGreater? Well, welcome my friend! This website is just starting out, but, there’s going to be a lot of info that's on its merry way, and you certainly don’t have to read it all at once, but when it's here that would be nice, haha! And if you're a beginner, I recommend that you start here. Cruise on down below to find what topics this site plan to talk about that will without a doubt (code for: hopefully) add value to your life, and no need to rush... take your time. There’s nothing wrong with moving like a cloud in the sky, lol. Enjoy!</p>

									<h2>Starting line: Absorb information and Connect</h2>
									<p><b>Connect with me via Social Media.</b> Follow me on your favorite social media network(s): <a href="https://www.twitter.com/BamaMagassa/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ibrahim.magassa/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="ttps://www.instagram.com/bama.magassa/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. I like to share some inspirational quotes and knowledge to liven up your day.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Now let's answer your questions about our topics:</h2>
									<p>Now of course I'm not going to be making up topics out of thin air. You will know these topics indeed. But, this site plan on helping you view it from all angles for the best possible motivation and inspiration around. I don't just want to tell you the same information you see everywhere... you can get that anywhere. What I want is to have you to better understand these topics whether it be working for your lifestyle or even developing a sound mindset.I want to get you to understand that anything is possible, but, just because you copy someone elses formula doesn't mean you'll have the same outcome as that person. It might be because that formula was best suited for them, and knowing that you have to understand what you need to do in order to create a formula that best suits you.</p>

									<div class="row">
										<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
											<h3>Mindset</h3>
											<p>Thinking in a way where you see reality fr what it is and not for what you think it is. Setting up the mind to remove those shades and see the world for it true self.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
											<h3>Awareness</h3>
											<p>I basically mention and explain this in the mission on the homepage. But, this will talk about how you understand and why you should understand things that happen they way they do and to not be angry but accepting.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
											<h3>Focus</h3>
											<p>Within this topic, we will talk about how important keeping in mind your big picture is when it comes to accomplishing anything. Always keep in mind that big picture of success. Stay focused and achieve your goals.</p>
										</div>
									</div>

									<div class="row">
										<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
											<h3>Goals</h3>
											<p>Within this topics, we'll be talking about accomplishing goals. I know sometimes it can be very difficult at times to start and finish a goal you set out for yourself to complete. Well in order for something to be impossible, no one must do it, but, the second someone does do it, then it becomes possible. So instead of waiting for someone else to do it, make that <strong>someone</strong> be <strong>you</strong>.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
											<h3>Self-Development</h3>
											<p>Here we'll talk about when there is a challenge in front of you that you need to face in order to continue moving forward simultaneously crafting yourself into a better version of yourself.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
											<h3>Time</h3>
											<p>Time is something that is valuable to each and every one of us. That's the one thing you can never get back, no matter how hard you try. Within this topic it will talk about how you should focus on working hard now, so that you can have more time to enjoy more things you want to do in the future. That my friends is called investing in yourself.</p>
										</div>
									</div>

									<div class="row">
										<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
											<h3>Happiness</h3>
											<p>Here obviously we'll be talking about happiness. But we're not going to be talking about "Oh, I wish my life was full of happiness therefore, it well be"..ahh, no. We'll be talking about how to work hard to obtain happiness.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
											<h3>Freedom</h3>
											<p>Within ths topic, we'll be talking about how to truly feel free. I don't think there is more I need to say.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<p>All of the topics I mentioned above all intertwine with each other in some way. They all rely on one another in order to reap the full benefits.</p>

I'm learning as I go through life, just like every one of you guys. I would love to hear (aka read, lol) what's on your minds. Hope you don't already think I don't want to talk to you guys...bring on the emails, drop me a message to my dusty old email inbox with that contact form in the sidebar, haha! Don't ever think you're not welcomed to send me a message. That thought needs to go...like yesterday, lol. As you guys probably noticed, I like to use lol quite often. Well how else are you going to know when I'm cracking up at my own jokes, haaaaa.</p>
